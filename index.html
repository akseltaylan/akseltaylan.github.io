Here are some highlights!<br><br>During the early phases of production I assisted in <b>stylized looks explorations for the environments</b> of the film. I developed a pipeline which generated a binary texture at render-time depicting what parts of the scene are in light versus in shadow, which shading artists could use in their shading networks via projection to make a material look different when it was lit versus in shadow. <br><br>One of the major technical challenges were the volumetric, dynamic, simulated characters. I worked extensively on improving our <b>volumetric character pipeline</b> to meet the needs of the film. Additionally, I co-developed <b>a method for shading and simulating the crowd characters</b> with minimal storage and render cost, primarily focusing on the water characters. To do this, we utilized render-time Houdini Engine procedurals, allowing us to accomplish shots with thousands of dynamic simulated characters that look almost identical to their full-fidelity counterparts. I presented this project with my colleagues at the ACM SIGGRAPH conference in summer 2023. You can read more about our technique in our SIGGRAPH abstract, linked below. <br><br><a title='itch.io' target='_blank' href='https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ElementalCrowd/paper.pdf'><i class='fa fa-external-link' style='font-size:24px'></i></a></p>";
